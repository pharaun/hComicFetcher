hComicFetcher
-------------

To be frank, this is some really bad code, but its mainly a project for quickly sketching out what works and what doesn't work api wise and code wise for a webcomic/manga fetcher.

Its a very much WIP project and the api/code needs a ton of cleaning up and refining which will eventually happen once i've gotten several sites/endpoint implemented then I can get a good feeling of what works and what does not.

Once that has happened, the API will be cleaned up and the whole thing will be made much more abstract and modular so that for each new site added all that needs to happen is a plugin/module for handling the parsing specifics of that site.
